//! x11_get_windows is a Rust crate that makes it easier to query the x11 windowing sytsem
//! to get the names of windows running on the computer.
//! 
//! [Link to online docs.](https://hirunya.github.io/docs/x11_get_windows/x11_get_windows/)
//! 
//! This is done by querying the `_NET_CLIENT_LIST` property for the list of windows
//! and `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` for the current active window.
//! This seems to be a part of what is known as the
//! ["Extended Window Manager Hints"/"NetWM" standard.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints)
//! However your Desktop Environment may not follow this convention and therefore
//! please make an issue if it doesn't work.
//! Furthermore as the only computer that I run this is on is running the KDE Plasma Desktop Environment
//! I am curious as to what other Desktop Environments can work with this.
//! So please feel free to tell me if it works on your Desktop Environment by making an
//! issue on this crate's Github repo.
//! 
//! The WMCTRL CLI tool's source code was used as a reference when making this.
//! 
//! Big Disclaimer: I am not used to writing and using raw C-bindings
//! and I don't write C/C++ in general,
//! so if you find a memory leak or some other problem,
//! **Please** make an issue on the Git repo.
//! 
//! # Examples
//! Getting a list of all the window titles on the screen.
//! ```ignore
//! let mut session = Session::open()
//!     .expect("Error opening a new session.");
//! session
//!     .get_windows()
//!     .expect("Could not get a list of windows.")
//!     .iter()
//!     .filter_map(|x| x.get_title(&session.display).ok())
//!     .for_each(|x| println!("{:?}", x.as_ref()))
//! // This might produce:
//! //// "Window Title 1"
//! //// "Window Title 2"
//! //// ""
//! //// "Window Title 3"
//! // etc.
//! ```
//! Get the currently active window, and find its title
//! ```ignore
//! let mut session = Session::open()
//!     .expect("Could not open a new session.");
//! println!("{:?}",
//!     session.active_window()
//!         .expect("Error getting the active window.")
//!         .get_title(&session.display)
//!         .expect("Error getting the title of the window."));
//! ```
//! 
//! If you are going to be using either a [Session] or a [Display] struct more than once,
//! please use the same one for each time as [x11::xlib::XOpenDisplay] is used when opening,
//! and [x11::xlib::XCloseDisplay] is used on drop.
//! 
//! # Links:
//! Here are some possibly helpful links that I used when making this crate and might be helpful if you want to go past the small functionality of this crate:
